Subject: Request for Leave of Absence

Hello Ma'am,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to formally request a leave of absence from work for today, 09th May 2024, due to unforeseen circumstances.

This morning, while on my way to the office, I unfortunately lost my phone. As a result, I had to make a detour to the police station to file a report for the lost phone. Regrettably, this process took longer than expected, and I found myself unable to make it to the office on time.

Understanding the importance of my responsibilities, I immediately informed my Senior, Bhavana Ma'am, about the situation. After considering the circumstances, it was decided that it would be best for me to take a leave of absence for the day to manage the situation and ensure a swift resolution.

I assure you that I will remain reachable via email and phone throughout the day to address any urgent matters that may arise during my absence. Additionally, I will make every effort to complete any pending tasks or assignments upon my return to the office tomorrow.

I apologize for any inconvenience caused by my absence and appreciate your understanding in this matter.

Thank you for your attention to this request.

Regards,

Manisha Prajapati
